#Assignment 3: Concurrency Coding
Due Wed 10/11 at 11:00pm
You may work in groups of up to 3 Write your own code… do not look up a web solution and copy it… learning comes from thinking it through When done submit in Sakai a single zip file. The zip file will contain 2 folders, one for Dining Philosphers, and another for Sleeping Barber. In each problem folder you will have the Java source code files, and a document with the discussion.
Write a Java threads program to implement a solution to the Sleeping Barber problem.
Test it for concurrency issues
write an explanation (text document) explaining how your approach works
Can it deadlock? Does it show race conditions? Can any of the task starve?
Explain any strange or interesting behavior you notice

 Do the same for the Dining Philosophers problem.
